## What I've Learned 
This project has been essential in my learining and development of this module. From the application of the theory in the coursework to the leaning how to manage time, delegate workload and work effectively in a team. This project has been a fantastic oppurtunity to create a CPU with a reduced version of what is used in industry as well as learning how optimisation is important and the implementation of this. The opportunity to learn and work with peers, I had not previously worked with was an opportunityto see how others work and learn from the strengths and weaknesses of the individual members in the team, the group's varying experience allowed for teaching of valuable methodology inlcuding writing testbenches. I am very grateful for the work that the rest of my team has done as it has been beneficail to not only the project, but my development as well.

The scope of the project was time appropriate and the workload was difficult but did not require external sacrifices such as sleep to complete. The project allowed me to learn how to code as a team, with transcending the fear of editing or debugging code that one of my peers has written. My skills of debugging, writting readable code and communicating appropriately when struggling to other team members greatly improved over the scope of the project.
