## Work Contribution
- The allocation of work can be found in the Google Sheets link below:
  - // The link
- As a team, we all agree that both the list and GitHub commits do not accurately measure the contribution of team members due to the following reasons:
  1. When working together in Room 404, we would operate on only one of the laptops, so some commits made by team members are often a combined effort of two or more members 
  2. The effort revolving around testbench writing and debugging is often highly overlooked - commits with simple fixes often took hours / days of effort from more than one member to debug a small mistake 
- As such, it is highly recommended that readers refer to both the personal statements and logbooks of each member instead of strictly judging effort based on commits
