- Lab meetup (23/11)
  - Lab 4 parts were mostly completed before the lab meetup
  - Main issues discussed during meeting:
    - Should we group by making sub-top modules?
      - Not necessary
    - Note carefully the defining of wires and ports, there seems to be some confusion regarding those and also the internal and external interconnecting wires relative to each module.
    - Should we change module names to follow sth_sth.sv underscore standard?
      - Yes

- Group meetup (29/11)


- Group meeting (30/11)
