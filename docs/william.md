# William's Logbook

## Summary

- I was the **main tester** for the team.


## Explanation

As the most experienced verification engineer in the team, having done
a placement in industry, I quickly took the role of verification initially
and set out industry level practices with respect to usage of Git, C++ 
coding standards and testing. 

By establishing a thorough and robust testbenching early, this allows 
us to catch bugs as they appear, rather than having to stare at waves 
later down the line.


## Timestamps

### Week 1 (commencing 20/11/2023)

- Created an abstraction class for testbenches `BaseTestbench` and
`SyncTestbench` as well as `top_tb.cpp`, `instrmem_tb.cpp`, 
`program_counter_tb.cpp`, `signextend_tb.cpp` and `controlunit_tb.cpp`.
